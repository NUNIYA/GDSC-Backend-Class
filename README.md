The calculator app combines basic arithmetic with a fitness calorie calculator. It uses a menu-driven structure for user interaction, with separate functions for arithmetic and fitness calculations. The unique fitness feature calculates daily calorie needs based on user input. Main challenges included implementing robust error handling for various input types and creating a user-friendly console interface. I overcame these by adding input validation functions and a clear menu system. Integrating the fitness calculator seamlessly with basic operations required careful function organization. Balancing comprehensive error checking with code readability was tricky, solved by creating specific validation functions for each input type.
